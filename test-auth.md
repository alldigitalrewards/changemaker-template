# Auth Flow Test Guide

## Prerequisites
1. Supabase local instance running: `pnpm supabase start`
2. Database migrated: `pnpm prisma db push` 
3. Development server running: `pnpm dev`

## Test Flow

### 1. Sign Up Flow
- Navigate to `/auth/signup`
- Enter email: `test@example.com`
- Enter password: `password123`
- Select role: `PARTICIPANT` or `ADMIN`
- Click "Create account"
- Should redirect to `/auth/login` with success message

### 2. Login Flow  
- Navigate to `/auth/login` (or should be redirected)
- Enter email: `test@example.com`
- Enter password: `password123`
- Click "Sign in" 
- Should redirect to `/workspaces`

### 3. Workspace Access
- Should see workspaces page with user email and logout button
- Create or join a workspace
- Navigate to appropriate dashboard based on role:
  - Admin: `/w/{slug}/admin/dashboard` 
  - Participant: `/w/{slug}/participant/dashboard`

### 4. Role Protection
- Try accessing admin routes as participant - should redirect
- Try accessing routes without auth - should redirect to login

### 5. Logout Flow
- Click logout button on any protected page
- Should redirect to `/auth/login`
- Try accessing protected routes - should redirect to login

### 6. Challenge System Test (Post-Auth)

#### Admin Challenge Creation
- Navigate to `/w/{slug}/admin/challenges`
- Click "Create Challenge" button (coral-colored)
- Fill form: Title: "Test Challenge", Description: "Test description"
- Click "Create Challenge"
- Should see challenge appear in list immediately
- Check admin dashboard - challenge count should increase

#### Participant Challenge Enrollment  
- Login as participant or switch role
- Navigate to `/w/{slug}/participant/challenges`
- Should see the challenge created above
- Click "Join Challenge" button 
- Button should change to "âœ“ Enrolled" (disabled, outlined)
- Navigate to `/w/{slug}/participant/dashboard`
- Should see challenge in "Your Challenges" section
- Enrollment count should show 1

#### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check challenge was created
SELECT * FROM "Challenge" WHERE title = 'Test Challenge';

-- Check enrollment was created  
SELECT * FROM "Enrollment" WHERE "challengeId" = '{challenge-id}';

-- Verify workspace isolation
SELECT c.title, w.slug FROM "Challenge" c 
JOIN "Workspace" w ON c."workspaceId" = w.id;
```

## Expected Results
- [x] Signup creates Supabase user with role metadata
