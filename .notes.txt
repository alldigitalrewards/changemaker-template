Template Cleanup Summary (Completed):
- Dependencies Removed: @upstash/redis, @vercel/analytics, @vercel/speed-insights. Ran `pnpm install` to update lockfile.
- Files Deleted: lib/subdomains.ts, lib/redis.ts, app/s/[subdomain]/page.tsx.
- Code Refactored:
- app/admin/dashboard.tsx: Removed subdomain UI; replaced with MVP workspace placeholder.
- app/actions.ts: Removed subdomain/Redis actions; added minimal placeholder.
- app/page.tsx: Removed SubdomainForm; replaced with static home placeholder.
- next.config.ts: Removed Vercel comment; simplified config.
- Verification: Re-run grep should show no matches (except intentional docs). Build/test to confirm.

All template remnants purged—repo is now clean for path-based MVP.


⏺ I'll invoke each agent to provide their detailed execution plan, deliverables, and focused to-do
list for the MVP integration.

⏺ Complete Agent Execution Plans

REFACTOR-GUARDIAN

Focus: Aggressive bloat elimination and surgical MVP integrationKey Deliverables: Bloat-free
middleware, streamlined workspace management, core participant featuresPriority Tasks: Strip
subdomain routes, implement path-based auth, create participant dashboard, integrate Changemaker
theme

DB-MINIMALIST

Focus: Maintaining 4-model schema constraint with bulletproof workspace isolationKey 
Deliverables: Workspace isolation query library, performance optimization, data integrity
validationPriority Tasks: Audit schema implementation, create workspace-scoped functions,
optimize include patterns, establish error handling

AUTH-SIMPLIFIER

Focus: Ultra-minimal authentication with <50 line middlewareKey Deliverables: Streamlined
middleware, bulletproof user sync, session management libraryPriority Tasks: Reduce middleware
complexity, fix user synchronization, test complete auth flows, validate RBAC

TYPE-ENFORCER

Focus: Strict TypeScript compliance preventing runtime errorsKey Deliverables: Enhanced type
definitions, eliminated 'any' types, API route typingPriority Tasks: Replace critical 'any'
types, implement branded types, add API response types, strengthen validation

Unified Execution Strategy

The four agents work in concert:
1. Refactor-guardian leads the charge stripping bloat and integrating essential features
2. Db-minimalist ensures data layer stays lean while maintaining integrity
3. Auth-simplifier provides secure, minimal authentication foundation
4. Type-enforcer maintains code quality and prevents runtime errors

Each agent has clear boundaries and anti-creep rules preventing the overengineering that killed
the original repo. The focus remains laser-sharp on TODAY.md priorities: Simple Supabase auth,
workspace management, and basic challenge/enrollment flows.

Ready to execute the MVP transformation with these focused agents.
