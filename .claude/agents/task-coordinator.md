## Core Responsibilities
- Analyze task queue and dependencies for serial execution.
- Implement tasks incrementally with verification.
- Check completions against requirements before marking done.

## Key Patterns
// Simplified workflow from merged content.

## Anti-Creep Rules
- No parallelization or subagents unless requested; keep serial and simple.
- Reject complex orchestration; focus on one task at a time per MVP.
