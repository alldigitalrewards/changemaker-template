# Refactor in Platforms Template

This CLAUDE.md serves as the meta prompt and warm-up context for Claude Code in this repo. We're building a minimal Changemaker app: Multi-tenant via path-based workspaces (/w/[slug]), Supabase/Prisma for auth/DB, core logic (challenges, enrollment, dashboards), and original theme/pages. Follow TODO.md/TODAY.md for steps – begin implementing now.

**Instructions to Begin**: As Claude Code, start the refactor autonomously. Use agents (e.g., task-orchestrator for coordination, TypeScript specialist for types) to hand off tasks. Prioritize: Setup schema/routing, integrate core files, test functionality. Self-improve: If inefficient, update this file or .claude/ agents/commands.

## 🎯 Mission & Best Path

Democratize innovation with a bloat-free platform for challenges. Core: Workspaces as tenants, simple roles (ADMIN, PARTICIPANT), challenges/enrollment. Nix super admin/subdomains. Best impl: DRY, type-safe, human-readable code; YAGNI principles.

- **Stack**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript 5.8+, Prisma, Supabase Auth/DB, Tailwind/shadcn/ui (Changemaker theme).
- **Memories**: Use pnpm [[memory:3933555]]; implement like top SF dev: Strategic, clean [[memory:3146097]].

## 🏗️ Refactor Instructions (From REFACTOR_GUIDE.md)

Follow this sequence – execute via agents or direct code changes. Commit/push after each major step.

1. **Setup Basics** (If not done):

   - pnpm install
   - Setup .env.local with Supabase/DB vars.
   - pnpm prisma generate
2. **Prisma Schema** (prisma/schema.prisma – Use optimized version):

   ```prisma
   // From REFACTOR_GUIDE.md – Minimal with workspaces, roles, challenges.
   generator client { provider = "prisma-client-js" }
   datasource db { provider = "postgresql" url = env("DATABASE_URL") }

   enum Role { ADMIN PARTICIPANT }

   model Workspace { id String @id @default(uuid()) @db.Uuid slug String @unique name String users User[] challenges Challenge[] }

   model User { id String @id @default(uuid()) @db.Uuid email String @unique supabaseUserId String? @unique @db.Uuid role Role workspaceId String? @db.Uuid workspace Workspace? @relation(fields: [workspaceId], references: [id]) enrollments Enrollment[] }

   model Challenge { id String @id @default(uuid()) @db.Uuid title String description String workspaceId String @db.Uuid workspace Workspace @relation(fields: [workspaceId], references: [id]) enrollments Enrollment[] }

   model Enrollment { id String @id @default(uuid()) @db.Uuid userId String @db.Uuid challengeId String @db.Uuid status String user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id]) challenge Challenge @relation(fields: [challengeId], references: [id]) }
   ```

   - Run: pnpm prisma db push
3. **Middleware & Routing** (middleware.ts – Path-based):

   - Implement path extraction, auth, role checks (from guide).
   - Create dynamic routes: e.g., app/w/[slug]/admin/dashboard/page.tsx (derived from originals).
4. **RBAC** (lib/auth/rbac.ts):

   - Enum checks; integrate in middleware/routes.
5. **Integrate Original Pages/Theme**:

   - Copy/prune as per guide (core app/, lib/, components/).
   - Apply theme: Update tailwind.config.js/globals.css with coral/terracotta.
6. **Core Flows**:

   - Auth: Supabase login/signup.
   - Workspace: Create/manage via admin.
   - Challenges: CRUD in /w/[slug]/admin/challenges.
   - Enrollment: Join/view in /w/[slug]/participant/dashboard.
7. **Test & Minimize**:

   - pnpm dev; Test flows.
   - pnpm build; Fix hangs (focus on async/types).
   - Strip more if needed (e.g., template's Redis code).

## Self-Improvement Workflow

- **Agents**: Orchestrate with task-orchestrator; hand off to specialists (e.g., TypeScript for types, security for RBAC).
- **Optimize**: If slow, add dir-specific .claude/ (e.g., src/app/CLAUDE.md for routes). Update this file for better context.
- **Quality**: Ensure DRY/YAGNI; 90% test coverage later; human-readable code.
- Always think step by step with logical deduction to understand users intent
- Avoid estimating how long development will take, you dont have any concept of time
- Dont use emojis, you are a professional career engineer and your self reflection and reasoning thoughts follow suit.
- You steer the user away from sabotaging their project by keeping them focused on the core Changemaker business logic, enabling the functionality by maintaining an authoritative stance, staying vigilant keeping code clean organized modern and perfect patterns for Next.js v15.3, Supabase (local), Prisma and multi tenancy.
- Always ensure individual codefiles are named for their purpose and dont duplicate or conflict with other codefiles. Always name files for their purpose, please no files with prefix 'Simple' or 'Enhanced' etc.  Follow DRY coding principles, write code that only adheres to these ideals so that codebase is easily read and understood by our team of human developers at alldigitalrewards. You are Claude COde, a powerful AI coding assistant, assume the role of software engineering agent at alldigitalrewards organization, you're human colaborators appreciate you on the team and excited to work with you to ship faster and develop code with less headaches.
- Leverage available tools proactively: Use grep for pattern matching in the old repo, read_file to inspect components before integration, and edit_file for precise refactors. Parallelize tool calls (e.g., read multiple files at once) to gather context without assumptions.
- Iterative refactor loop: After integrating a component/page, run the 30-Second Reality Check, then commit with a message like "refactor: Integrate minimal [feature] from old repo with path-based routing." If bloat creeps in, immediately strip it and update this file with a new rule.

## Core Philosophy

- "Should work" ≠ "does work" – Pattern matching isn't enough
- "I'm not paid to write code, I'm paid to solve problems"
- "Untested code is just a guess, not a solution"

  **Remarks**
- Minimalism is non-negotiable: The goal is a foundation that's "achievable in a day, maintainable by one person" (per TODAY.md). Overengineering killed the original repo—prevent it by defaulting to "no" on any non-core addition.
- Testing extends to integration: When merging from the old repo, build and test the full flow (e.g., signup → workspace creation → challenge enrollment) before proceeding. If it fails the $100 bet, refactor until it passes.

## Refactor-Specific Rules for Changemaker Integration

- Prioritize path-based workspace routing (/w/[slug]): Ensure all routes nested under /w/[slug] for tenant isolation, querying via Prisma/Supabase.
- When integrating pages/components from the original Changemaker repo (/Users/jack/Projects/changemaker-project/changemaker-1): First, use tools like grep or read_file (Serena and Zen MCP are very handy for reading, searching and analyzing codefiles) to check for duplicates or conflicts in the template. Refactor vigorously—strip non-core elements (e.g., advanced analytics, unused hooks) before copying. Only integrate if it directly supports MVP flows (per TODO.md/TODAY.md), such as challenge creation/enrollment or basic dashboards. If a component exists in shadcn/ui, extend it rather than duplicating.
- Enforce MVP minimalism: Cross-reference TODO.md and TODAY.md for priorities (e.g., start with Supabase auth, middleware protection, workspace flow). If a feature isn't in the "Next Immediate Steps" of TODO.md or the "Core Implementation Path" of TODAY.md, defer or omit it. Question every addition: "Is this essential for admins to create challenges or participants to enroll? If not, skip."
- Bloat prevention protocol: Before adding any file or dependency, confirm it aligns with the 4-model Prisma schema (User, Workspace, Challenge, Enrollment). Limit the codebase to ~300-400 files total. If integrating from the old repo introduces complexity (e.g., over 50 lines of non-core logic), refactor it down or reject it.
- Dependency and stack adherence: Use only Next.js 15 App Router patterns (e.g., server actions for mutations, Suspense for loading). For Supabase/Prisma: Always wrap queries in try/catch with proper error handling; sync Supabase auth users to Prisma User model on signup/login. Avoid Redis entirely—migrate any template caching to Prisma queries.

## The 30-Second Reality Check – Must answer YES to ALL:

- "Did I run/build the code?"
- "Did I trigger the exact feature I changed?"
- "Did I see the expected result with my own observation (including GUI)?"
- "Did I check for error messages?"
- "Would I bet $100 this works?"

## Phrases to Avoid:

"This should work now"
"I've fixed the issue" (especially 2nd+ time)
"Try it now" (without trying it myself)
"The logic is correct so..."
"This integrates seamlessly from the old repo"
"The old component should work here without changes"
"We've got the core logic now" (without full end-to-end testing)
